# Title Config value type coercion loses tags and handles several input types inconsistently


## Description
Ansible configuration values passed through `ensure_type()` can lose their data tags during type conversion and behave inconsistently for several supported value types. Tagged values may return untagged converted results, unhashable values can fail during boolean conversion, bytes can produce unclear conversion behavior, and sequence or mapping inputs may not be normalized to the requested `list` or `dict` types.
This affects configuration handling because callers expect `ensure_type()` to preserve trust and origin metadata while reliably coercing values according to the configured type.

## Requirements

- `ensure_type()` must continue to return `None` unchanged when the input value is `None`, regardless of the requested value type.

- When the requested type is `bool` or `boolean`, `ensure_type()` must use Ansible's standard non-strict boolean conversion rules, including returning `False` instead of raising when an unhashable non-boolean value is provided.

- `ensure_type()` must coerce `True` and `False` to `1` and `0` respectively when the requested type is `int` or `integer`.

- `ensure_type()` must reject invalid conversions with a `ValueError` whose message reads exactly `Invalid value provided for '<type>': <value>`, where `<type>` is the requested type name and `<value>` is the offending value rendered with Python `repr` (for example, `Invalid value provided for 'int': 'a'`, `Invalid value provided for 'list': b'a'`, or `Invalid value provided for 'int': -1.1`).

- Byte values must be rejected for known value types instead of producing undefined behavior or unhandled exceptions.

- When the requested type is `list`, string inputs must be split on commas with whitespace stripped and quoted items unquoted, while sequence inputs such as tuples must be returned as concrete `list` instances.

- When the requested type is `dict` or `dictionary`, mapping inputs must be returned as concrete `dict` instances.

- `pathspec` and `pathlist` conversions must reject non-string inputs and non-string list items instead of attempting to resolve them as paths.

- String values read from INI configuration sources must continue to be unquoted after type coercion.

- Converted values must preserve Ansible data tags from the original value, including preserving tags on each element produced when a tagged string is converted to a list. When conversion does not change the value, `ensure_type()` must return the original value instance unchanged.

- Temporary path conversions using `tmp`, `tmppath`, or `temppath` must create a unique empty directory under the resolved base path and must not propagate tags to the returned temporary path.

- Unknown value types must return the input value unchanged, except that string values from INI configuration sources must still follow the standard unquoting behavior.

- For `str`/`string`, only str, bool, int, float and complex inputs are valid; sequences/mappings/bytes are invalid conversions.

- In the `Invalid value provided for '<type>': <value>` message, `<type>` is the `value_type` string exactly as passed by the caller (lowercased), e.g. `'tmp'`, `'none'`, `'dict'`, `'integer'`; never a canonical alias such as `'temppath'`, `'None'`, or `'dictionary'`.

- `none` is a recognized value type: `None` and the literal string `'None'` convert to `None`; any other input for it is an invalid conversion. `tmp`/`tmppath`/`temppath` and `dict`/`dictionary` reject non-string / non-mapping inputs (such as the int `1`) with the same ValueError.

- Converted `int` and `list` results must carry the data tags of the original value: for an `Origin`-tagged input converted to `int` or `list` (including a `list` built from a tagged tuple), `Origin.is_tagged_on(result)` must hold, and when a tagged string is split into a `list` every element must itself be tagged.

- Failed numeric coercions must surface only as the `ValueError` with the exact message above, never as any other exception type: for example `'a'`, `'NaN'`, `'1.1'`, `-1.1` and `b'10'` for `int`, and `'a'` or `b'a'` for `float`.
