## Title Device management does not support signing out of multiple sessions at once

## Description
The device management interface only allows users to sign out of one session at a time. This makes session cleanup repetitive when a user needs to remove multiple devices.

Users should be able to select multiple devices from the device list, see how many sessions are currently selected, cancel the selection, and sign out of all selected sessions in a single action.

## Requirements

- Users must be able to select and deselect individual devices from the device list.

- When one or more devices are selected, the device list header must display the number of currently selected sessions using the wording `%(selectedDeviceCount)s sessions selected`.

- When one or more devices are selected, the device list header must show a bulk sign-out action that signs out all currently selected device IDs in a single request.

- When one or more devices are selected, the device list header must show a cancel action that clears all selected devices.

- The bulk sign-out action must use `data-testid="sign-out-selection-cta"`.

- The cancel action must use `data-testid="cancel-selection-cta"`.

- Each selectable device checkbox must use `data-testid="device-tile-checkbox-${device.device_id}"`.

- A selectable device's checkbox `checked` state must reflect whether the device is selected.

- Clicking the selectable checkbox or the device tile information area must toggle that device selection.

- Clicking actions inside a device tile must not toggle device selection.

- When the active device filter changes, all selected devices must be cleared.

- After a successful device sign-out, the device list must refresh.

- If interactive authentication for device sign-out is cancelled, the sign-out loading state must be cleared.

## Interfaces

No new interfaces are introduced.

## Published acceptance clarification

Use the existing SelectableDeviceTile and FilteredDeviceList component APIs in the checkout. Where FilteredDeviceList needs selection passed from its caller, expose `selectedDeviceIds` and `setSelectedDeviceIds` props. The test IDs and wording listed above are acceptance interfaces, not hidden styling preferences. Keep existing pusher/notification props compatible.
