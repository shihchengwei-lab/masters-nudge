## Title: Search index updates cannot be handled per record type or inspected afterwards


### Description
Currently works, authors and editions each travel their own route through one large batch routine, so none of them can be processed or extended apart from the others, and behavior meant for all of them only takes effect where it was written into a particular route. A batch also reports nothing back once it finishes, so what it added and removed cannot be inspected.

## Requirements

- `SolrUpdateState` should represent one pending update through its `keys`, `adds`, `deletes` and `commit` fields, should be constructible from part of that information as in `SolrUpdateState(commit=True)`, and any collection left out should start empty and unshared, with no commit requested.

- `solr_update` should accept such a representation and send its deletions, additions and commit request as one Solr command body, keeping its existing treatment of successful, unavailable, non JSON, invalid request, partial document error and other non OK responses without letting a response parsing error escape.

- The per record operation should be reachable as `update_key`, should return one of these representations, and should be awaitable for every record type, authors included.

- `WorkSolrUpdater` should handle work and edition documents alike, should index an edition with no work as a synthetic work rather than removing it, and should carry a title supplied by an associated edition onto the resulting document.

- `AuthorSolrUpdater` should index the author it receives rather than removing it, keeping that author key on the document it produces.

- `update_keys` should handle `/works/`, `/authors/` and `/books/` keys through the behavior of each record type and return one representation carrying all their additions and deletions, requesting a commit unless the caller asks for none.

- Documents the in memory data provider already holds, deletions and redirects among them, should be resolved from it without an external Solr search, and keys whose documents have type `/type/delete` should all end up among the deletions with nothing added.

- A `/books/` redirect should contribute its own key to the deletions and be followed to the document at its `location` in its place, standing ahead of that target when the target is itself deleted.

- `SolrUpdateState` must represent a complete Solr update using readable `keys`, `adds`, `deletes`, and `commit` fields. These collection fields must default to independent empty lists, and construction with keyword arguments such as `SolrUpdateState(commit=True)` must be supported.

- A `SolrUpdateState` must be able to serialize its pending additions, deletions, and commit flag as Solr command JSON for use by `solr_update()`.

- `solr_update()` must accept a `SolrUpdateState` as its update input and send the serialized additions, deletions, and commit request to the selected Solr endpoint. Existing handling of successful, unavailable, non-JSON, invalid-request, partial-document-error, and other non-OK responses must remain unchanged and must not expose an unhandled response-parsing error.

- Record-specific updater operations must return a `SolrUpdateState`. `WorkSolrUpdater.update_key()` must accept both work documents and edition documents that have no `works` field. For such an orphan edition, it must index a synthetic work rather than deleting anything.

- When an associated edition supplies a title, that title must be preserved in the resulting work document.

- `AuthorSolrUpdater.update_key()` must index the author rather than deleting anything, and the resulting document must retain the input author key.

- `update_keys()` must process `/works/`, `/authors/`, and `/books/` keys using their corresponding record-specific updater behavior and return one aggregated `SolrUpdateState`.

- Documents available through the in-memory `data_provider` must be processed from that provider without requiring an external Solr search. This also applies to `/books/` documents representing deletions or redirects.

- When the documents associated with the supplied keys have type `/type/delete`, the returned state must contain every supplied key in `deletes` and no additions.

- When a `/books/` document is a redirect, its source key must be added to `deletes` before processing its `location` target.
