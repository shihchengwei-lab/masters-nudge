# Title: Support dual-format segment targeting in feature flag rules


## Description
The `segment` field in feature flag rule definitions currently only supports a single string key for segment targeting. This limits rule expressiveness when users need to target multiple segments with logical operators (e.g., AND/OR) within a single rule.
Rules that require multi-segment targeting have no unified way to represent both a simple single-segment reference and a compound multi-segment grouping within the same configuration field. This inconsistency affects import, export, and persistence of rule configurations across environments.

## Requirements

- The rule configuration must support a unified `segment` field that accepts two formats: a plain string for a single segment key, or an object containing a list of keys and a logical operator.

- The system must correctly serialize the `segment` field to YAML in both formats: a string value when a single segment key is used, and a nested object with `keys` (list) and `operator` (string) when multiple segments are used.

- The system must correctly deserialize the `segment` field from YAML, distinguishing between a plain string and an object with `keys` and `operator`.

- When creating or updating a rule with a single segment, the segment operator must default to `OR_SEGMENT_OPERATOR`.

- When creating or updating a rollout with a single segment, the segment operator must default to `OR_SEGMENT_OPERATOR`.

- Exporting a rule with a single segment must produce the string format for the `segment` field. Exporting a rule with multiple segments must produce the object format with `keys` and `operator`.

- Importing a configuration that uses the object format for the `segment` field must correctly map the keys and operator to the internal rule representation, including support for operators such as `AND_SEGMENT_OPERATOR` and `OR_SEGMENT_OPERATOR`.

- Configuration snapshot logic must correctly read and persist both segment representations, extracting keys and operator when the object format is used.

- When exactly one segment key is supplied, the stored/returned operator must be OR_SEGMENT_OPERATOR regardless of any operator in the request.

- The dual string/object `segment` format applies to rule definitions only. Rollout YAML keeps its existing `segment: {key: <segmentKey>, value: <bool>}` shape unchanged on import and export.
